## Title : 

Signed networks intercommunities

## Abstract : 

Signed Networks in Social Media presents a study on how well can the theories of balance and the theory of status predict the relationships between INDIVIDUAL users on social networks.

We propose to study how these theories can explain the relationships between COMMUNITIES, and the "online social networks" they represent.

To do this we will investigate the Reddit Hyperlink Network dataset.

In Reddit, a sub-reddit can be seen as a community, where individual users "subscribe" to a subreddit and become "affiliated" to it, by being active and posting.

And sometimes, some posts in a sub-reddit can contain hyperlinks to other an sub-reddit, either to "neutrally" evoque it, "praise" it or "insult" it.

We say a hyperlink originates from a post in the source community and links to a post in the target community.

We will study how well can the analyses made for individual users can be made on communities.


## Research questions :

How effective are the two theories (balance and status) in explaining/predicting the relationship (i.e sign of edges)
between communities ?

What are the differences and similarities between communities and
individual relationships ?

Are there some assumptions that can be made to transform the individuals datasets (i.e Epinions, Slashdot, Wikipedia) into communities dataset (by clustering and viewing clusters as communities) that gives us similar results as the community one we already have (i.e Reddit) ?

How effective are our methods in modeling relationships between
communities and where are the biases and limitations of this
method ?

## Proposed dataset :

We will use the Reddit Hyperlink Network (link : https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-RedditHyperlinks.html).

It is a list of posts, whith attributes relating the source subreddit from which the post originates, the target subreddit, and the sentiment of the post.

Thus it represents a **directed, signed, temporal** subreddit-to-subreddit hyperlink network.

- It is extracted from publicly available Reddit data of 2.5 years from Jan 2014 to April 2017.

- The most important columns we will make us of : 

	- SOURCE_SUBREDDIT: the subreddit where the link originates.

	- TARGET_SUBREDDIT: the subreddit where the link ends.

	- TIMESTAMP: time of the post.

	- POST_LABEL : label indicating if the source post is explicitly negative towards the target post. The value is -1 if the source is negative towards the target, and 1 if it is neutral or positive. The label is created using crowd-sourcing and training a text based classifier, and is better than simple sentiment analysis of the posts.

## Methods :

To build the networks we will use the Python NetworkX package.

First, we will load the data, and make some data sanitizing by removing the columns we do not need, transforming subreddit names by unique node IDs.

Then, because we will have duplicates in (SOURCE, TARGET) pairs (because the same source subreddit can contain multiple posts that convey a similar/different sentiment to the same target subreddit), we will average the POST_LABEL signs of all the duplicates to have a unique "weight" that is between -1 and 1.

We will have enough information to make a **weighted, directed, signed** network.

We will look in the literature, or/and think of feasible methods that embodies the theory of status and theory of balance for **weighted** networks.

The most naive method that comes to mind is to simply take the sign of the weight, to have an ordinary **signed network**, as the one investigated in the original paper, and that is our first track to follow.

We will try to reproduce key results found in the paper but for the Reddit-Community dataset, such as results of different tables and make analyses of these results, comparing them with the individuals datasets.

If it turned out that the results for this naive method are inconclusive, we will try to find a better method of analysing the Reddit-Community **weighted** network under the scopes of Balance and Status theories.

And if time permits, we will try to transform our individuals networks (i.e Epinions, Slashdot, Wikipedia) into a network representing communities, by clustering, computing "averages" over the signs in/out-going edges between clusters, giving us weights, with which we will deal similarly as how we dealt with the Reddit-Community dataset, to try to see if there is meaning in viewing such clusters of people as Communities.

## Proposed timeline :

- **Week 1**: 
	- Downloading of the dataset.
	- Perform some data wragling.
	- Compute average signs to build the weighted network.
	- Search for other methods that embodies the theory of status and theory of balance for weighted networks.

- **Week 2**:
	- Implement the naive ordinary signed network (using only the sign of the weight).
	- Reproduce the key results/tables of the paper.
	- Start Analysing the similarities and differences of the relations between individuals and those of communities.
	- Implement (especially if results are inconclusive) other methods that can deal more accuratly with signed networks
	- Try to transform our initial datasets into network of communities by clustering.

- **Week 3**:
	- Continuing with analysis and compare results for reddit communities and the created communities (Epinions, Slashdot, Wikipedia).
	- preparing the datastory or report.

## Organization within the team :


**Week1** : 
	Ahmed will handle downloading the dataset and perform data wragling. He will build the weighted network and share the resulting code and datasets with the other members of the team.
	Salim and Ghassen will both de the research to find methods that can be implemented to deal with signed weighted networks

**week 2** (or earlier if time allows it):
	Ghassen will implement the naive ordinary signed network using only the sign of the weights.
	Reproducing the key results and tables of the paper will be divided and tackled seperately by each member of the team.
	We will then analyse the results and compare the similarities and differences and decide on whether we will implement other methods to deal with weighted signed networks (and which ones ?). Salim and Ahmed will implement them.
	Ghassen will try and transform our initial datasets into network of communities by clusterting

**week 3**:
	Salim and Ahmed will both analyse and compare the created communities with the reddit communities and prepare all needd figures and exemple while writing the data story
	Ghassen will focus on setting up the data story webpage (design, interactive visualizations if needed)
	The whole team will prepare the video presentation

## Questions for TAs :

Since as an individual work for Milestone4, each team member will have to reproduce Table 3, we wanted to ask if it'll be a problem since we will also have to do it as a team to show and analyse the results for the reddit communities:

	--Response: * Well, it is a bit tricky! Other teams have asked me the same question. Following is what I think should be the best way to proceed: "You guys can discuss work specific to replicate Table 3, but, then code this part yourself individually. There is a high likelihood, if you don't discuss during implementation, it would come out quite differently. I know that it is sort of an overkill and a waste of time, but this is how it is. Replication of Table 3 is an individual task, and you can see that we take copying quite seriously. A note was sent to all the students, for whom, we found the P2 assignment to be similar. Hope you find an efficient way to work things out! Feel free to reach out again if you need further clarifications."


We also wanted to ask if you think that the naive method (the one that takes into account only the sign) could alter the results and be inconclusive ? (i.e do you think we shouldn't make the simplification of discarding the weight keeping only the sign for each edge between communities? :

	--Response: * It is very hard to judge analytically whether the naive method would work or not. This is something that you will have to try!



## Reasoning and Results

**Subreddit Hyperlink Network**: the subreddit-to-subreddit hyperlink network is extracted from the posts that create hyperlinks from one subreddit to another. We say a hyperlink originates from a post in the source community and links to a post in the target community.

Note that each post has a **title** and a **body**. The hyperlink can be present in **either the title** of the post or **in the body**. Therefore, we provide one network file for each.

The first step will be to concatenate those two datasets and provide w full dataset containing all directed and signed connexions between subreddits

The data contains 40 months of Reddit comments and posts


**BALANCE THEORY** :

- Considers the possible ways in which triangles on three individuals can be signed.
- it posits that triangles with **three positive signs** (3 mutual friends), and those with **one positive sign** (2 friends with common enemy) are more plausible (more prelevent) than triangles with **two positive signs** (2 enemies with common friend) or **none** (mutual enemies)


**STATUS THEORY** :

- We need to define our proper way of formulating the status theory. Given the low pourcentage of negative links (10% in all the links) we can say that a negative link from community A to community B may mean that community B is my enemy / wrong  and a positive link from A to B may be I get along well with community B

	Max Weber developed the idea of **"status group"** which is a translation of the German Stand (pl. StÃ¤nde). Status groups are communities that are based on ideas of lifestyles and the honor the status group both asserts, and is given by others. Status groups exist in the context of beliefs about relative prestige, privilege, and honor and can be of both a positive and negative sort.

==> We can therefore say that a **positive** link from A to B means that A **agrees/respects** B's ideas/lifestyle , and a **negative link** from A to B means that A **disagrees/disrespects** B's ideas/lifestyle.

Our **replication of Figure 2** of Signed networks paper for Epinions dataset didn't match the one in the paper, but the deductions and informations that the figures gives us remain the same. But for Reddit dataset , we found that the predictions of status with respect to both generative and receptive surprise perform the same way as the predictions of structural balance.

We need to state, as mentioned in the notebook, to deal with multiple weighted edges between same two nodes in Reddit dataset, we implemented two methods: One takes into account every edge and create a **MultiDirGraph**, whilst the other assign a single edge with a computed **mean of all weights** between those two nodes. 

Even by using the **mean as weight**, we saw that the mean sign of the edges is by majority **1 or -1** .
From this, we decided to define **"FRIENDS Communities"** by the communities from which originated multiple (ie : >=3) positive edges. and **"ENEMIES communities"** by the communities from which originated (ie : >=3) negative edges.

We saw that there are some subreddits, like **mongolianhatewatch**, that are involved only in **negative links**. Generally, we saw that those negative links are generated in a short amount of time. This may inform us of a possible dispute between the subreddits, or a hatred accounts.

We showed that in Reddit dataset the pourcentage of negative edges that originated from the set of SOURCE subreddits that led to more than 2 conflicts are at **57.6%** responsible of all negative links. And that **76.2%** of the "ENEMIES Communities" are responsible for **ALL negative links** in Reddit dataset.
